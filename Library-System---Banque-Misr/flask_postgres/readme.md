# Library System Setup

This project is a library system built with Flask, providing two roles: user and admin. Users can borrow and return books, register and log in, search for books, and browse the entire collection. Admins can log in, manage the collection of books, and view users.

## Flask Application Overview

### User Role:
- **Borrow and Return Books**: Users can borrow multiple books at a time and return them.
- **Register and Login**: New users can register for an account and log in to the system.
- **Search and Browse Books**: Users can search for specific books by title or author and view the entire library collection.

### Admin Role:
- **Login**: Admins can log in to manage the library.
- **Manage Books**: Admins have the ability to add or remove books from the collection.
- **View Users and Books**: Admins can browse the list of registered users and view all books available in the library.

## Running the Flask App

Once your resources are deployed, the Flask app will provide two interfaces: one for users and one for admins. Both roles have separate functions, with users able to borrow and return books, while admins manage the libraryâ€™s inventory.
